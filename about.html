                <p>Hello, my name is Yunheng Li, though you can call me Leon. I am currently a second-year Manufacturing Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). My academic focus is on developing advanced technical skills and a deep understanding of modern manufacturing processes, with the goal of contributing to innovative solutions in the industry.</p>
                
                <p>I was born in Shenzhen, China, and moved to Montreal, Canada at the age of 13. This transition exposed me to diverse perspectives and fostered my passion for problem-solving and innovation, which led me to pursue a career in engineering. My experiences in both countries have shaped my approach to challenges, combining a strong technical foundation with a global mindset, and I am eager to contribute to the advancement of the manufacturing industry.</p>
                
                <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including fishing, basketball, video games, and following motorsports like WRC and Formula 1. These interests help me stay balanced and fuel my passion for problem-solving and precision in both my personal and professional life.</p>
                
                <p>Entering the manufacturing program has reaffirmed my passion for the field, particularly through gaining practical experience with advanced machinery such as CNC and water jet cutters. The hands-on training has enhanced my understanding of manufacturing processes and strengthened my commitment to the industry. I am excited to apply these skills in a professional setting and look forward to contributing to innovative projects as I begin my career in the manufacturing industry.</p>
