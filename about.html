                <p>My name is Leon, and I am a second-year Manufacturing Engineering student
                    at UBC, focused on developing advanced technical skills in modern
                    manufacturing processes. Originally from Shenzhen, China, I moved
                    to Montreal at the age of 13, which provided me with a global
                    perspective and a passion for problem-solving. My hands-on
                    experience with advanced machinery, including CNC and water jet
                    cutters, has strengthened my technical foundation and commitment
                    to the industry. I am eager to apply my skills to contribute to
                    innovative solutions and drive advancements in the manufacturing
                    sector.</p>
